todo: better state management

- perhaps get data in the top level then pass down as props
- we can then separate last updated and ticker components
- also would work better for setting the page title dynamically
- not related but making the text flash on updates would be nice
- find a source for data that updates more than once per minute
- get it to work in IE11 (the error messages are so cryptic)
